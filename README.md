# JIGSAW - Learn Your Missing Piece

Welcome to **Jigsaw**, our hackathon project for **CS Girlies Hackathon - Make Learning Fun Again!**
We're here to make learning fun again - turn any topic into an interactive quiz and discover your missing piece of knowledge, one AI-powered question at a time.

## How It Works!
1. **Upload a PDF (Max size: 5MB)**
   - Pick a PDF of any topic you want to learn.
2. **Pick a Country**
   - Default Country: United Kingdom
   - On the map page, select it (highlighted in Cyan) to continue.
3. **Answer Quiz Questions**
   - The AI generates the questions and options after parsing your PDF.
   - **Rules:** Max **2 wrong attempts** per question, else the game restarts!
4. **Auto-Download of Results**
   - Finish all questions correctly and you get a PDF with:
     - All questions asked
     - Correct answers
    Perfect for reviewing later!

## Future Goals
- Introduce a **points system**: Use the coins collected in the quiz to unlock new countries
- Currently, only **United Kingdom** is unlocked, but more countries are coming soon!
